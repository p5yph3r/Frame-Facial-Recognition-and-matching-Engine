# Frame - Facial Recognition and Matching Engine

Frame was created for final year engineering project. The main idea of the project is to use facial recognition for everyday activities like office/college attendence, booking a hotel/cab etc as a plugin . In our use case we have created a system which could use facial recognition for booking a taxi. This repository consists the theoretical research work, the blackbook and the research paper which was published in the journal of our college ( St. John college of Engineering and Management). All the codes are present in another repository.
